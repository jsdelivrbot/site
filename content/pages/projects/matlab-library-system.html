Have you ever became angry due to the path handling in MATLAB. If you do, this project could be interesting for you. 

__MATLAB Library System__ is a library handling module that makes shipment and adding/removing MATLAB scripts and functions convenient for you and your customers.


# Using the system

## Manual way

1. Create a new folder that will be the root folder of your project.
1. Copy the content of this repository into that folder.
1. Edit the library name if you want _(see details later)_.
1. Copy your project into the `library` folder.
1. Done. Your project is ready to ship.
1. You can test your library by running the `install.m` script.

## Command line way

1. Clone this repository to your system:<br />
   `git clone git@github.com:tiborsimon/MATLAB-Library-System.git my_library`<br />
   You can edit the folder name according to your needs.
1. Edit the library name if you want _(see details later)_.
1. Copy your project into the `library` folder.
1. Done. Your project is ready to ship.
1. You can test your library by running the `install.m` script.

# Folder structure

__MATLAB Library System__ has got a simple folder structure.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/tiborsimon/aa4f1fa04736459a6018.js"></script>

# Modifying the library properties

There are three library properties you can edit in the `my_library/librarydata.txt` file indexed by the rows of the file:

1. Library name
2. Library version
3. Message to the user after installation _(optional)_

Further lines will be ignored.

The default `librarydata.txt` file looks like this:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/tiborsimon/9a3c197ad4ade3347afa.js"></script>

These settings will produce the following output during installation.
