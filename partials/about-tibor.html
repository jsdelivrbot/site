My name is <strong>Tibor Simon.</strong><br><br>
I am a graduated <strong>electrical engineer</strong> with a master's degree. I live in <strong>Budapest</strong> and I am currently working at Nokia Networks.
As an engineer I constantly pushing myself to be better at what I am doing. I like to <strong>discover</strong> new technologies, <strong>experiment</strong> with ideas. I am a <strong>Vimmer</strong>, I use <strong>Linux</strong>, I am a late night <strong>owl</strong>, and I prefer the <strong>command line</strong> over the mouse. Yes, I felt into the <strong>unproductive hole of tools</strong> a few times, yes I have a huge pile of <strong>unfinished projects</strong> and yes this is the (n+1)th iteration of my webpage. But hey, that doens't matter as far as <strong>I enjoy it</strong>. Oh, and I like to play the <strong>guitar</strong> and I also like to take <strong>pictures</strong>. Hope you find someting useful here.
